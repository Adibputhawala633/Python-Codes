# Python-Codes
Basic Python Code which help us to learn python 

1.Implement a Python program to swap two numbers without using a third variable.
2. Create a program to display memory locations of two variables using id() function, and
then use identity operators to compare whether two objects are the same or not.
3. Write a program that evaluates an expression given by the user at run time using eval()

4. Write a python program to add two numbers using command line arguments.
5. Implement a program to check if a number is prime or not.
6. Write a Python script to create a Student’s Marksheet.
7. Write a menu driven python program which perform the following:
● Find area of circle
● Find area of triangle
● Find area of square
● Find area of rectangle
Hint: Use infinite while loop for Menu
8. Write a python program that asks the user to enter a length in centimeters. If the user
enters a negative length, the program should tell the user that the entry is invalid.
Otherwise, the program should convert the length to inches and print out the result.
(2.54 cm=1 inch).
9. Write a program to demonstrate String function.
10. Write a program to demonstrate List function.
11. Write a program to demonstrate Tuple function.
12. Write a program to demonstrate the Dictionary function.
